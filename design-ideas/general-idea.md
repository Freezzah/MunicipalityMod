# Municipality Mod 

## Introduction

The mod is inspired by [MineColonies](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies), however, there will be numberous things differently. As MineColonies focusses on resource gathering, the focus of Municipality will be about a stable economy, trust, happiness and several other core aspects. The mod will be resource costly, not beneficial. The goal is to provide a challanging environment for the player to maintain their Municipality.

## Core mod
You start off by having nothing. No city, no villages, no tools or materials. Your first goal would be to establish a townhall. To do so, you need more than just some materials to do so. As in real life, you can only start a village if you have enough support to sustain yourself with help of others.
More on the start of your municipality in [Starting a village](#starting-a-village). 

## Maintaining the city
After creating your city, you will need some inhabitants. These can both be players (in server) or NPCs (in singleplayer). Both in essence work the same. You can ask them to do several tasks for you which will produce a small amount of goods.
Your farmer can harvest wheat, which is required to keep your city alive. Your banker can store goods for the mayor. Your warehouse can distribute goods.
All these will be required for your city to florish. The better your city functions, the happier the people will be (see [happiness](#Happiness)).
Expanding your city is required to unlock new tiers for your city. First you will have a few buildings, but the more your progess, the more buildings you unlock. (See [Progress City](#Progress-City))(BROKEN)

## Buildings
- Townhall
  - Main building of your city. Can only be destroyed by mayor or transferred with key. When this is spawned, players or NPCs can be added to the municipality. This building also has an overview of the happiness, effectiveness and level of the municpality
- Bank
  - Can store (like a chest) items for the mayor. Its a secure system where only allowed people can grab items from. (Subdivision?)
- Warehouse
  - Central hub for items in your city. Producers bring stuff here, consumers consume from here. Transporters can move items between warehouses.
- Farmer
  - Can farm materials. Based on the selected recipe it can harvest several different goods. Note that this is very slow and should be used only in singleplayer
- Miner
  - Can mine materials in a dedicated area. Note that this is very slow and should be used only in singleplayer
- Builder
  - Builds the final buildings from their coreblock.
- Soup kitchen
  - Cooks several types of food for the Garanary
- Garanary
  - Distributes food to NPCs and Players. Note that the mod will have a seperate foodbar. It will not heal you, but will hurt when not filled. Has influence on happiness. 
- Smith
  - What do you think
- Toolshop
  - Might be merged with smith, might also have a distributing function for tools.
- Armory
- Event place
  - Generates happiness in exchange for certain items (new items like e.g. tents, knights (provided by armory), gladiators, foodtrucks, whatever we can think of)
- Police?
- Medics?
- ?


## Starting a village
To start a village, a few requirements must be met. This is in line with the reality that you cannot just found a city anywhere. Additionally to having resources (e.g. wood and food), you need support. In the early stages of the city, this is done by endorcements, which can be (crafted or traded). Having three endorcements from unique players (or npcs (done by trading with them on single)) will allow you to found a city. Encorsements must be from players which are not in a municipality yet, as creating a municipality will add the players to the municipality. A player can only be in one municipality, and municipalities can only be created in the overworld. Once the city is founded (by using a townhall block and clicking through the UI), the municipality is created. After this, a set period is started (2 hours?). Within this time, you need to: 
- Build your townhall 
- Build atleast two houses (Yes you sleep with two people in one house, get used to it).

When the time has passed and the requirements have not been met, the municipality will be destroyed as will the blocks related to the municipality. If the requirements have been met, the municipality is definitifly founded and the major is appointed.

## Upgrading a Municipality
There are five levels for a municipality. The idea is to relate this to real world municipalities based on localization. Eg. the netherlands would be [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalities_of_the_Netherlands):
1. Aalten
2. Almelo 
3. Arnhem
4. Delft
5. The Hague 

Idea is to have multiple options based for the levels.
Level one is activated when the municipality is definitive. Each level after will require more buildings, higher happiness, more inhabitants and a payment of money (ofc not RL money).

## Happiness
One of the core stats of the mod is the happiness factor. This decides how well the municipality is running and determines whether the municipality can progress or not. Happiness of NPCs is automatically determined based on the flow of the municipality. Idle NPCs graduately lose happiness, aswell as homeless NPCs or NPCs with one or no foodtypes. For players, this will be determined by the contribution to the municipality. Players who have no contributed much are regarded unhappy. Removing players from the municipality also has a negative impact on the happiness. On the other hand, new buildings, a smooth progress, and several different types of food (or other mechanics, e.g. level of tools) will have a positive effect on the happiness. 
There are three levels of happiness. Unhappy means the municipality might lose a level. When this happens, buildings of the higher level will become idle. Happy means that the municipality will continue working as normal. Excited means the option opens up to level up the municipality. 

## Buildings
Buildings consist of a core block. This block can always be placed. In order to make the block into a building, a builder (or a player), needs to build the structure according to a desing. This can only be done if A) there are enough resouces. B) There are enough funds and C) The city has not reacher any threshold (like level or capacity). When the building is done, a player or NPC can take the job and fullfill the duty of the building. More detailed explaination in the specific building description.
