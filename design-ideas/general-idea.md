# Municipality Mod 

## Introduction

The mod is inspired by [MineColonies](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies), however, there will be numberous things differently. As MineColonies focusses on resource gathering, the focus of Municipality will be about a stable economy, trust, happiness and several other core aspects. The mod will be resource costly, not beneficial. The goal is to provide a challanging environment for the player to maintain their Municipality.

## Core mod
You start off by having nothing. No city, no villages, no tools or materials. Your first goal would be to establish a townhall. To do so, you need more than just some materials to do so. As in real life, you can only start a village if you have enough support to sustain yourself with help of others.
More on the start of your municipality in [Starting a village](#starting-a-village). 

## Maintaining the city
After creating your city, you will need some inhabitants. These can both be players (in server) or NPCs (in singleplayer). Both in essence work the same. You can ask them to do several tasks for you which will produce a small amount of goods.
Your farmer can harvest wheat, which is required to keep your city alive. Your banker can store goods for the mayor. Your warehouse can distribute goods.
All these will be required for your city to florish. The better your city functions, the happier the people will be (see [happiness](#Happiness)).
Expanding your city is required to unlock new tiers for your city. First you will have a few buildings, but the more your progess, the more buildings you unlock. (See [Progress City](#Progress City))

## Buildings
- Townhall
  - Main building of your city. Can only be destroyed by mayor or transferred with key. When this is spawned, players or NPCs can be added to the municipality. This building also has an overview of the happiness, effectiveness and level of the municpality
- Bank
  - Can store (like a chest) items for the mayor. Its a secure system where only allowed people can grab items from. (Subdivision?)
- Warehouse
  - Central hub for items in your city. Producers bring stuff here, consumers consume from here. Transporters can move items between warehouses.
- Farmer
  - Can farm materials. Based on the selected recipe it can harvest several different goods. Note that this is very slow and should be used only in singleplayer
- Miner
  - Can mine materials in a dedicated area. Note that this is very slow and should be used only in singleplayer
- Builder
  - Builds the final buildings from their coreblock (see [Core Block](#core block)).
